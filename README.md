### 🚀 Featured Projects

**IHungryBurgerShop — LinkedList Edition (Java / Swing)**  
A full GUI-based burger ordering system (school coursework). Uses a custom `Node` linked list for in-memory order management with pages for placing, viewing, updating, and categorising orders (Processing, Delivered, Cancelled).
